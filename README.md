# Posture-Correction-Model
A project created by using Tensorflow.JS, Posenet, ML5.JS, P5.JS which tracks the body postures of the user and in case the posture of the user incorrect,
then it blurs the screen of the user and also sends an alert sound.
I learned this project from CodeforCause YouTube channel in 30days ML workshop
